//! The secondary-index registry, persisted in the reserved `$metadata` table.

//! Every index definition lives in a single metadata value (a small blob under

//! plain read-modify-write with no per-index key scheme to design. Each entry is
//! scoped by table name, so two tables may reuse an index name.
