//! Rooted transaction views.
//!
//! [`ReadTxn::rooted`](super::ReadTxn::rooted) and
//! [`WriteTxn::rooted`](super::WriteTxn::rooted) return a [`RootedRead`] /
//! [`RootedWrite`] that interprets every path relative to a fixed root: each call
//! joins `root` with the given path and forwards to the underlying transaction,
//! so `txn.rooted("users/alice")?.get("age")` reads
//! `users/alice/age`. Resolution still walks from the table root each time (the
//! root is a path prefix, not a cached key), so the view stays correct even as the
//! tree under `root` is created or replaced.
//!
//! A view borrows its transaction, so it must be dropped before the transaction
//! is committed — the same rule write accessors follow. Views nest: `rooted`
//! again to descend further.
